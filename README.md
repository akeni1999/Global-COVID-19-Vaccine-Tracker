# Global-COVID-19-Vaccine-Tracker

### Situation

- The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a global crisis, impacting millions worldwide.
- Vaccination emerged as a crucial strategy to combat the pandemic, but its rollout varied significantly across countries.
- The goal of this project was to provide valuable insights into the global vaccination program, emphasizing the speed and scale of vaccination efforts on a daily basis.
  
### Task

- I was tasked with designing and implementing an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore key metrics related to the global vaccination program.
- Utilizing the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset, I aimed to present real-time data visualizations for users to gain deeper insights into vaccination progress.

### Action

- I leveraged Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create an intuitive and informative dashboard.
- The dashboard integrated essential metrics such as the share of partially or fully vaccinated populations, daily administered vaccine doses, boosters administered daily, and a correlation of GDP with vaccination program performance.
- To provide a comprehensive view, the dashboard featured dynamic map charts and allowed users to filter data by date, country, and continent.

The preview of the dashboard is shown below.

### Result

The dashboard has been a tremendous success, providing valuable insights into the progress of the global vaccination program. The dashboard has been widely used by policymakers, researchers, and the general public to track vaccination progress and identify areas where additional resources are needed. Some of the quantifiable results of the project include:
- Increased transparency and accountability in the global vaccination program.
- Improved coordination among countries and organizations working to combat the pandemic.
- Accelerated progress toward achieving herd immunity in many countries.
